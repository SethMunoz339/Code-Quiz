## Usage

When the page opens, the user is presented with a "Start Quiz" button. When clicked, it starts the quiz, bringing up the first question and answer buttons. As each question is answered, a new question is brought up. If the questions are answered correctly, the score increases. If the questions are answered incorrectly, the time left on the quiz is reduced. When the quiz ends, either by all the questions being answered or by the timer running out, the user can enter a high score which is saved in local storage and displayed on the screen. The user can clear the high score list by emptying local storage using a "Clear High Scores" button.
